**Project Description**
    
    This project is an "AI and Decentralization" application designed to generate and securely store study notes. The application allows users to upload a document (PDF, DOCX, or TXT), which is then processed by an AI to produce a concise summary. This summary can then be pinned to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized network, ensuring the notes are permanently stored and resistant to censorship.

**Project Overview**
    
    The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the integration of modern AI models (such as Gemini or Ollama) with decentralized storage solutions, highlighting a practical use case for Web3 technologies.

**Key Features**
    
    AI-Powered Summarization: Upload a document and get a concise summary of its key points.

    Decentralized Storage: Save the generated notes to IPFS, a peer-to-peer network.

    Persistent & Verifiable Data: Content saved to IPFS is verifiable via a unique Content Identifier (CID) and remains available as long as it is pinned.

    Modern UI: A clean, responsive, and intuitive user interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

**Technologies Used**
    
    Frontend: Next.js, React, and TypeScript

    Styling: Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui

    AI Backend (To be integrated): Gemini or Ollama

    Decentralization (To be integrated): IPFS (via a service like Pinata or Web3.Storage)
